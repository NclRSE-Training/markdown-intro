# Creating a New Note

Log into HackMD

Create a new note by clicking on the green <style="background-color:green;"> ```+``` </style> :

![HackMD]({{relative_root_path}}/fig/HackMD.png)

You should now have a new note on your screen. The screen will be divided into two parts. The section on the left, which is black, is the editor. The section on the right, in white, is the rendered version of the document:

![NewNote]({{relative_root_path}}/fig/NewNote.png)

### Adding text:
Let's start creating our document by entering some text in the editor (black) area. We'll start with a heading. To create a heading we start the line with ```#```. Notice the space after the hash:

```# Lorem Ipsum``

We can also create a subheading by using two hashes. Don't forget the space after the hashes:
``` ## What is Lorem Ipsum?```

Followed by some text:

```
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
```
We can italisize some of the text by adding an asterisk on each side

```*Lorem Ipsum*```

With extra asterisks we can make the text bold

```**Lorem Ipsum**```

or even italisized bold:

```***Lorem Ipsum***```

### Making lists:
