# Creating a New MarkDown file

Log into GitHub and select a repository or create a new one. A MarkDown file is created like any other file but it needs to have a .md extension. So click on the ```Add file```button and select ```Create new file```:

![GitHub]({{relative_root_path}}/fig/Create_new_file_GitHub.png)

Enter a filename and make sure to end it with the extension .md:

![Name file]({{relative_root_path}}/fig/Enter_filename.png)

Remember: If at any stage, you would like to see the rendered version of what you have typed, select the ```Preview``` tab.
