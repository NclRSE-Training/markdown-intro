# Creating a New Note

Log into HackMD

Create a new note by clicking on the green ```+```  :

![HackMD]({{relative_root_path}}/fig/HackMD.png)

You should now have a new note on your screen. The screen will be divided into two parts. The section on the left, which is black, is the editor. The section on the right, in white, is the rendered version of the document:

![NewNote]({{relative_root_path}}/fig/NewNote.png)

{% include links.md %}
